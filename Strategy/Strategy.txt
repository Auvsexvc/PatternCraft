    /// The Strategy Design Pattern can be used, for example, to determine how a unit moves in the StarCraft game.
    /// The pattern consists in having a different strategy to one functionality. A unit, for example, could move by walking or flying.
    /// Complete the code so that when a Viking is flying its position increases by 10 each time it moves. If it is walking then the position is increased by 1.
    /// Viking starts as a ground unit when it is created.
