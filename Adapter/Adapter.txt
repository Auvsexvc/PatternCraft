    /// The Adapter Design Pattern can be used, for example in the StarCraft game, to insert an external character in the game.
    /// The pattern consists in having a wrapper class that will adapt the code from the external source.
    /// The adapter receives an instance of the object that it is going to adapt and handles it in a way that works with our application.
    /// Complete the code so that we can create a MarioAdapter that can attack as other units do.
    /// Note to calculate how much damage mario is going to do you have to call the jumpAttack method.
