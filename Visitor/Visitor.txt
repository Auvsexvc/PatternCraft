    /// The Visitor Design Pattern can be used, for example, to determine how an attack deals a different amount of damage to a unit in the StarCraft game.
    /// The pattern consists of delegating the responsibility to a different class.
    /// When a unit takes damage it can tell the visitor what to do with itself.
    ///
    /// Complete the code so that when a Tank attacks a Marine it takes 21 damage and when a Tank attacks a Marauder it takes 32 damage.
    /// The Marine's initial health should be set to 100 and the Marauder's health should be set to 125.
